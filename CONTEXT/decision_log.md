## [DECISION-001] Modular Monolith over Microservices

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
GoRola is a 0-to-1 product in a niche geography (Mussoorie hills). The team is small (likely 1-2 developers). We need to move fast but not at the cost of future scalability.

**Decision:**
Build as a Modular Monolith — single deployable unit with strong internal module boundaries following Controller → Service → Repository.

**Rationale:**
- Microservices add enormous operational overhead (service discovery, network latency, distributed transactions, multiple deployments) that is unjustified at this scale.
- A well-structured modular monolith can be extracted into microservices later when needed — the module boundaries are the future service boundaries.
- Single deployment = simpler CI/CD, simpler debugging, simpler local dev.
- Railway free tier supports one Node.js service perfectly.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Cannot scale individual modules independently (e.g., scale the order service without scaling auth). Acceptable at current scale.
- If team grows to 10+ engineers working on the same repo, coordination overhead increases. At that point, extract to services.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Microservices from day 1 — rejected: premature complexity for 1-2 person team
2. Pure MVC monolith (no module boundaries) — rejected: becomes unmaintainable pasta after 3 months

## [DECISION-002] Fastify over Express for Backend

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Need a Node.js HTTP framework. Express is the default choice. Fastify is newer.

**Decision:**
Fastify v4.

**Rationale:**
- 2-3x faster than Express (benchmarks: ~77,000 req/s vs ~25,000 req/s)
- Built-in schema validation and serialization (JSON Schema — though we use Zod at controller level)
- TypeScript-first design with better type inference
- Plugin system is more structured than Express middleware
- Pino logger is built-in (vs Express where you bolt it on)
- Built-in support for async/await without wrapper hacks

**Tradeoffs:**
- Smaller ecosystem than Express (fewer ready-made middleware packages)
- Less community knowledge — harder to find solutions to edge cases
- Plugin system has a different mental model (decorators, encapsulation)

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Express — battle-tested but showing age, no TypeScript-first design
2. Hono — ultra-fast, edge-native, but less mature ecosystem for full apps
3. NestJS — framework with DI, very opinionated, adds significant boilerplate and abstraction layers

## [DECISION-003] Prisma over TypeORM/Drizzle for ORM

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Need a TypeScript ORM for PostgreSQL with good migration support.

**Decision:**
Prisma v5.

**Rationale:**
- Best-in-class TypeScript type generation from schema (auto-generated, always in sync)
- Prisma Studio for visual data exploration during dev
- Migration workflow is simple and reliable (prisma migrate dev)
- Prisma Accelerate available for connection pooling when needed
- Most readable query API of any ORM

**Tradeoffs:**
- Prisma generates its own query engine binary (adds ~30MB to node_modules)
- Less flexible for complex raw SQL queries — must drop to `$queryRaw`
- Schema is in its own DSL (not TypeScript) — another thing to learn
- Not as thin as Drizzle — more "magic" happening

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. TypeORM — messy TypeScript decorators, history of bugs, harder migrations
2. Drizzle — very thin, TypeScript-first schema, but migrations less mature, smaller ecosystem
3. Raw SQL with pg — maximum control, but too much boilerplate for a team of 1-2

## [DECISION-004] cuid2 over UUID for Primary Keys

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Need to choose a primary key strategy for all entities.

**Decision:**
cuid2 (via `@paralleldrive/cuid2` package).

**Rationale:**
- URL-safe characters (no hyphens) — cleaner in URLs
- Monotonically increasing (within same millisecond, random segment varies) — better B-tree index performance than random UUID
- Shorter than UUID v4 (24 chars vs 36)
- Collision-resistant (cryptographically random component)
- No sequential prediction (unlike auto-increment integers)

**Tradeoffs:**
- Not a standard — UUID is universally understood by all tools
- cuid2 is less widely known
- Not supported by some older database GUI tools

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. UUID v4 — universally supported but random (poor index performance at scale), longer
2. UUID v7 — monotonic UUID, good alternative, but still hyphenated and 36 chars
3. Auto-increment integer — simple but exposes record counts, makes sequential scraping trivial

## [DECISION-005] Soft Delete for All User Data

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
How to handle deletion of records (products, addresses, orders, users)?

**Decision:**
All deletes are soft deletes via `isDeleted: Boolean @default(false)`. Hard deletes never happen except for a specific PII purge flow (GDPR stub for future).

**Rationale:**
- Business needs: "Why did this order fail?" requires historical data
- Support needs: customer says "I deleted my address by mistake" — we can restore it
- Analytics: deleted products still appear in order history
- Audit trail: admin needs to see what was deleted and when

**Tradeoffs:**
- All queries must filter `WHERE is_deleted = false` by default (handled in repository layer)
- Tables grow larger over time — but not a problem at current scale
- Slightly more complex repository code

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Hard delete with archive tables — complex, duplicates schema
2. Hard delete + event sourcing for history — massive over-engineering for v1

## [DECISION-006] Phone OTP (not Email OTP or Social Auth) for Buyers

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
How should buyers (customers) authenticate?

**Decision:**
Phone number + SMS OTP via Fast2SMS (India-specific, free tier).

**Rationale:**
- Target market: India, hills region. Phone numbers are universal. Email is NOT universal in this demographic.
- OTP on phone is the expected auth pattern for Indian consumer apps (Swiggy, Zomato, Blinkit all use this)
- Fast2SMS: India-focused, free tier (100 credits/day), reliable for low volume
- Lower friction than email (no mailbox to open, instant delivery)

**Tradeoffs:**
- Phone-dependent: if user changes number, account migration needed
- International buyers need different OTP providers (future: Twilio)
- Fast2SMS free tier limited (100 OTPs/day) — upgrade to paid when volume increases

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Email OTP — not universal for target demographic
2. Google/Apple Social Auth — requires app store presence + privacy policy + developer accounts
3. WhatsApp OTP — good for India, but requires Meta Business account and API approval
4. Twilio — reliable but costs money from day 1

## [DECISION-007] RS256 JWT over HS256

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
JWT signing algorithm choice.

**Decision:**
RS256 (asymmetric: RSA private key signs, public key verifies).

**Rationale:**
- In a multi-service future (Phase 5+), services can verify tokens using only the public key — they don't need the private key
- Private key stays in API service only — reduced attack surface
- Industry standard for production applications

**Tradeoffs:**
- More complex key management (RSA key pair vs single secret)
- Slightly slower signing than HS256 (negligible at this scale)
- Requires generating and securely storing RSA key pair

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. HS256 — simpler, single secret, but every service that verifies tokens needs the secret (risk)

---

## [DECISION-008] No localStorage for Tokens

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Where to store JWT access and refresh tokens on the frontend.

**Decision:**
HttpOnly Secure SameSite=Strict cookies only. No localStorage, no sessionStorage.

**Rationale:**
- localStorage is accessible to JavaScript — any XSS vulnerability exposes all tokens to theft
- HttpOnly cookies are inaccessible to JavaScript — XSS cannot steal them
- Secure flag: cookie only sent over HTTPS
- SameSite=Strict: prevents CSRF on navigation

**Tradeoffs:**
- Requires CSRF protection (double-submit cookie or SameSite=Strict handles most cases)
- Slightly more complex cross-origin setup (credentials: 'include' required)
- Not trivially accessible from JS (intentional)

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. localStorage — rejected: XSS-vulnerable
2. In-memory only (JS variable) — rejected: lost on page refresh, poor UX
3. sessionStorage — rejected: lost on tab close, still XSS-vulnerable

## [DECISION-009] Railway.app for Free Deployment

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Need free hosting that supports Node.js + PostgreSQL + Redis in one platform.

**Decision:**
Railway.app for API + DB + Redis. Vercel for frontend.

**Rationale:**
- Railway free tier: $5 credit/month, PostgreSQL and Redis as managed services, zero-downtime deploys
- No cold start penalty (unlike serverless platforms)
- GitHub integration: auto-deploy on push to main
- Prisma migrations run as part of deploy command
- Vercel: best-in-class for React/Vite static sites, free tier generous, global CDN

**Tradeoffs:**
- Railway free tier has sleep after 30min inactivity (can cause slow first response)
- 512MB RAM limit on free tier (sufficient for our load)
- Not as scalable as AWS/GCP — but we'll migrate when revenue justifies it

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Render.com — similar free tier, good alternative, but Railway has better PostgreSQL support
2. Heroku — once free, now paid only
3. Fly.io — great but more complex setup (Docker required)
4. Supabase — considered for DB only, but would split our stack

## [DECISION-010] Landmark-Based Addresses (No Pin Code)

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
How to collect delivery addresses in a hill town where formal addresses don't exist, streets are unnamed, and pin codes are irrelevant for last-mile navigation.

**Decision:**
Mandatory landmark description field ("near the red gate, behind Hotel Padmini") + optional flat/room number. No pin code field. Optional lat/lng from draggable map pin.

**Rationale:**
- Mussoorie has ~200,000 residents + significant tourist traffic. Formal addresses (D-45 Sector 3) are meaningless here.
- Local riders navigate by landmarks (everyone knows "the red gate" or "Clock Tower")
- Pin code-based systems fail in hill towns — multiple areas share the same pin code
- Tourist buyers won't know their own address — but they know the hotel name
- This is how Zomato/Swiggy actually work in smaller Indian cities: landmark fields

**Tradeoffs:**
- Cannot use automated routing or geocoding based on address text alone
- Requires riders to know the area (they do — that's the point)
- Harder for first-time buyers to know what to write (addressed by placeholder copy)

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Standard address form (street, city, pin) — rejected: unusable in this geography
2. Lat/Lng only from GPS — rejected: tourists don't trust GPS accuracy in hills, buildings not mapped well
3. What3Words — considered but adds third-party dependency and learning curve

## [DECISION-011] BullMQ for Background Jobs

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Some operations should be async: sending OTP SMS (don't make user wait for SMS API), sending order confirmation notifications, generating reports.

**Decision:**
BullMQ with Redis. Already have Redis for sessions, so no additional infrastructure.

**Rationale:**
- Redis-backed: persistent queues (jobs survive server restart)
- Rate limiting built in (matches our OTP rate limiting needs)
- Retry with backoff: if Fast2SMS is slow, job retries automatically
- Dashboard: Bull Board for monitoring (can add later)
- Already have Redis — no extra infra cost

**Tradeoffs:**
- Additional complexity in the codebase (workers, queues, job types)
- Debugging async failures is harder than synchronous failures

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Synchronous OTP send — simpler but user waits for SMS API (can be 1-3 seconds)
2. pg-boss (PostgreSQL-backed queues) — good, but adds complexity when we have Redis anyway
3. In-memory queue (no persistence) — rejected: jobs lost on server restart

## [DECISION-012] GSAP over Framer Motion for Animations

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The design calls for premium scroll-based animations and smooth page transitions. Which animation library?

**Decision:**
GSAP v3 with ScrollTrigger plugin for all scroll-based and timeline animations. Lenis for smooth scroll.

**Rationale:**
- GSAP is the industry standard for premium web animations (used by Apple, Netflix, etc.)
- ScrollTrigger is the best-in-class scroll animation tool
- Performance: GSAP uses requestAnimationFrame and optimizes painting
- Lenis + GSAP is the canonical pairing for "smooth scroll website" experiences
- The design system explicitly calls for topographic backgrounds, fog drift, ETA pulse — all well-suited to GSAP
- GSAP is free for non-commercial + many commercial uses (GreenSock standard license)

**Tradeoffs:**
- Heavier than CSS transitions or Framer Motion for simple animations
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger = ~70KB (minified+gzipped: ~25KB) — acceptable for a premium web app
- Requires imperative programming style (refs in React) vs Framer Motion's declarative

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Framer Motion — good for component-level animations, but limited for complex scroll sequences
2. CSS animations only — cannot achieve the level of animation sophistication required
3. AOS (Animate on Scroll) — too simple, CSS-only, not customizable enough

## [DECISION-013] TanStack Query for Server State

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Managing server state (API data) in React. Options: Redux, Zustand, TanStack Query, SWR.

**Decision:**
TanStack Query (React Query) for server state. Zustand for pure client state (auth, cart UI, weather mode toggle).

**Rationale:**
- TanStack Query handles: caching, background refetch, stale-while-revalidate, optimistic updates, pagination, infinite scroll — all built in
- Separates server state from UI state — cleaner mental model
- Zustand is perfect for simple global UI state (is cart open? is weather mode on?)
- No Redux — too much boilerplate for what we need

**Tradeoffs:**
- Two state management solutions in one project — but they serve clearly different purposes
- TanStack Query has a learning curve

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Redux Toolkit + RTK Query — good, but heavier than needed
2. SWR — similar to React Query but less feature-rich (no optimistic updates OOTB)
3. Zustand for everything — possible, but you'd reinvent React Query's caching logic

## [DECISION-014] Hybrid Env Bootstrap for Railway + dotenv-safe

**Date:** 2026-04-22
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Production deploys on Railway failed at bootstrap with `MissingEnvVarsError` from `dotenv-safe` even after setting variables in the dashboard. Two concrete issues appeared:
- Monorepo root path resolution was off by one level, so `.env.example` was searched under `/app/apps/.env.example` instead of `/app/.env.example`.
- `dotenv-safe` checks key presence using `Object.keys(process.env)`; Railway may omit some keys entirely rather than set empty values, causing strict validation to fail.

**Decision:**
Adopt a hybrid bootstrap in `apps/api/src/config/env.ts`:
1. Resolve monorepo root correctly (4 levels above `config` directory).
2. Ensure `.env` file exists on PaaS (create empty file when missing).
3. Load `.env` with `dotenv` first.
4. Prime missing keys from `.env.example` into `process.env` (including `DATABASE_URL_TEST <- DATABASE_URL` fallback) before running `dotenv-safe`.
5. Keep `dotenv-safe` as the final contract validator.

**Rationale:**
- Preserves strict configuration contract semantics from `.env.example`.
- Avoids false negatives caused by platform-specific env injection behavior.
- Keeps local dev ergonomics unchanged while making production bootstrap deterministic.
- Minimizes invasive changes to the rest of the app.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Adds env bootstrap complexity (`dotenv` + priming helper + `dotenv-safe`).
- Placeholders can satisfy key-presence checks even when not production-grade values; operational discipline still required in Railway Variables.
- Slightly more code to test and maintain in config initialization.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Remove `dotenv-safe` in production — rejected: loses safety guarantees and schema contract.
2. Set `allowEmptyValues: false` and rely purely on platform vars — rejected: still fails when keys are omitted entirely by host behavior.
3. Maintain a committed production `.env` template in runtime image — rejected: operationally fragile and risks secrets handling mistakes.
4. Replace with a custom Zod env loader only — deferred: possible future refactor, but more scope than needed for immediate deployment unblock.

## [DECISION-015] ESLint: simple-import-sort vs import/order on `order.service.ts`

**Date:** 2026-04-23
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
While adding `apps/api/src/modules/order/order.service.ts`, ESLint reported import issues. Running `eslint --fix` produced `ESLintCircularFixesWarning: Circular fixes detected` — two rules kept undoing each other’s fixes until the run could not converge.

**Decision:**
Disable `import/order` only for that file via a top-of-file comment:

`/* eslint-disable import/order -- simple-import-sort groups conflict with newlines-between: always for parent imports */`

Leave `simple-import-sort/imports` as the authority for import order and grouping in that module. Longer term, the project may relax or remove `import/order` in favor of `simple-import-sort` only, or narrow `newlines-between`, to avoid repeats.

**Rationale:**
- The root conflict is **two different import policies**: `eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort` defines order and newlines in one way; `eslint-plugin-import`’s `import/order` with `newlines-between: "always"` enforces extra blank lines between *groups* (e.g. external vs parent `../` vs sibling `./`, and sometimes between adjacent parent modules).
- Those rules **disagree** for files that mix `../catalog/...`, `../inventory/...`, and `./order.repository.js` — satisfying one can violate the other, producing circular autofixes.
- A targeted disable documents the reason and unblocks CI without changing global lint policy in one go.

**Tradeoffs:**
- `import/order` is not enforced in that one file, so a future contributor could add imports that `import/order` would have nudged; `simple-import-sort` still normalizes order on save/CI.
- A file-level `eslint-disable` is slightly noisier than a single source of import rules for the whole repo.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Remove `newlines-between: "always"` from `import/order` globally — broader change, affects every package; deferred until a dedicated lint pass.
2. Drop `simple-import-sort` and use only `import/order` — rejected: the repo has standardized on `simple-import-sort` for sort order; larger churn.
3. Re-export catalog/inventory from a single `order`-local barrel to reduce import paths — overkill to fix lint only.
