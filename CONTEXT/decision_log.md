## [DECISION-001] Modular Monolith over Microservices

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
GoRola is a 0-to-1 product in a niche geography (Mussoorie hills). The team is small (likely 1-2 developers). We need to move fast but not at the cost of future scalability.

**Decision:**
Build as a Modular Monolith — single deployable unit with strong internal module boundaries following Controller → Service → Repository.

**Rationale:**
- Microservices add enormous operational overhead (service discovery, network latency, distributed transactions, multiple deployments) that is unjustified at this scale.
- A well-structured modular monolith can be extracted into microservices later when needed — the module boundaries are the future service boundaries.
- Single deployment = simpler CI/CD, simpler debugging, simpler local dev.
- Railway free tier supports one Node.js service perfectly.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Cannot scale individual modules independently (e.g., scale the order service without scaling auth). Acceptable at current scale.
- If team grows to 10+ engineers working on the same repo, coordination overhead increases. At that point, extract to services.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Microservices from day 1 — rejected: premature complexity for 1-2 person team
2. Pure MVC monolith (no module boundaries) — rejected: becomes unmaintainable pasta after 3 months

## [DECISION-002] Fastify over Express for Backend

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Need a Node.js HTTP framework. Express is the default choice. Fastify is newer.

**Decision:**
Fastify v4.

**Rationale:**
- 2-3x faster than Express (benchmarks: ~77,000 req/s vs ~25,000 req/s)
- Built-in schema validation and serialization (JSON Schema — though we use Zod at controller level)
- TypeScript-first design with better type inference
- Plugin system is more structured than Express middleware
- Pino logger is built-in (vs Express where you bolt it on)
- Built-in support for async/await without wrapper hacks

**Tradeoffs:**
- Smaller ecosystem than Express (fewer ready-made middleware packages)
- Less community knowledge — harder to find solutions to edge cases
- Plugin system has a different mental model (decorators, encapsulation)

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Express — battle-tested but showing age, no TypeScript-first design
2. Hono — ultra-fast, edge-native, but less mature ecosystem for full apps
3. NestJS — framework with DI, very opinionated, adds significant boilerplate and abstraction layers

---

## [DECISION-003] Prisma over TypeORM/Drizzle for ORM

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Need a TypeScript ORM for PostgreSQL with good migration support.

**Decision:**
Prisma v5.

**Rationale:**
- Best-in-class TypeScript type generation from schema (auto-generated, always in sync)
- Prisma Studio for visual data exploration during dev
- Migration workflow is simple and reliable (prisma migrate dev)
- Prisma Accelerate available for connection pooling when needed
- Most readable query API of any ORM

**Tradeoffs:**
- Prisma generates its own query engine binary (adds ~30MB to node_modules)
- Less flexible for complex raw SQL queries — must drop to `$queryRaw`
- Schema is in its own DSL (not TypeScript) — another thing to learn
- Not as thin as Drizzle — more "magic" happening

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. TypeORM — messy TypeScript decorators, history of bugs, harder migrations
2. Drizzle — very thin, TypeScript-first schema, but migrations less mature, smaller ecosystem
3. Raw SQL with pg — maximum control, but too much boilerplate for a team of 1-2

## [DECISION-004] cuid2 over UUID for Primary Keys

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Need to choose a primary key strategy for all entities.

**Decision:**
cuid2 (via `@paralleldrive/cuid2` package).

**Rationale:**
- URL-safe characters (no hyphens) — cleaner in URLs
- Monotonically increasing (within same millisecond, random segment varies) — better B-tree index performance than random UUID
- Shorter than UUID v4 (24 chars vs 36)
- Collision-resistant (cryptographically random component)
- No sequential prediction (unlike auto-increment integers)

**Tradeoffs:**
- Not a standard — UUID is universally understood by all tools
- cuid2 is less widely known
- Not supported by some older database GUI tools

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. UUID v4 — universally supported but random (poor index performance at scale), longer
2. UUID v7 — monotonic UUID, good alternative, but still hyphenated and 36 chars
3. Auto-increment integer — simple but exposes record counts, makes sequential scraping trivial

---

## [DECISION-005] Soft Delete for All User Data

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
How to handle deletion of records (products, addresses, orders, users)?

**Decision:**
All deletes are soft deletes via `isDeleted: Boolean @default(false)`. Hard deletes never happen except for a specific PII purge flow (GDPR stub for future).

**Rationale:**
- Business needs: "Why did this order fail?" requires historical data
- Support needs: customer says "I deleted my address by mistake" — we can restore it
- Analytics: deleted products still appear in order history
- Audit trail: admin needs to see what was deleted and when

**Tradeoffs:**
- All queries must filter `WHERE is_deleted = false` by default (handled in repository layer)
- Tables grow larger over time — but not a problem at current scale
- Slightly more complex repository code

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Hard delete with archive tables — complex, duplicates schema
2. Hard delete + event sourcing for history — massive over-engineering for v1

---

## [DECISION-006] Phone OTP (not Email OTP or Social Auth) for Buyers

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
How should buyers (customers) authenticate?

**Decision:**
Phone number + SMS OTP via Fast2SMS (India-specific, free tier).

**Rationale:**
- Target market: India, hills region. Phone numbers are universal. Email is NOT universal in this demographic.
- OTP on phone is the expected auth pattern for Indian consumer apps (Swiggy, Zomato, Blinkit all use this)
- Fast2SMS: India-focused, free tier (100 credits/day), reliable for low volume
- Lower friction than email (no mailbox to open, instant delivery)

**Tradeoffs:**
- Phone-dependent: if user changes number, account migration needed
- International buyers need different OTP providers (future: Twilio)
- Fast2SMS free tier limited (100 OTPs/day) — upgrade to paid when volume increases

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Email OTP — not universal for target demographic
2. Google/Apple Social Auth — requires app store presence + privacy policy + developer accounts
3. WhatsApp OTP — good for India, but requires Meta Business account and API approval
4. Twilio — reliable but costs money from day 1

---

## [DECISION-007] RS256 JWT over HS256

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
JWT signing algorithm choice.

**Decision:**
RS256 (asymmetric: RSA private key signs, public key verifies).

**Rationale:**
- In a multi-service future (Phase 5+), services can verify tokens using only the public key — they don't need the private key
- Private key stays in API service only — reduced attack surface
- Industry standard for production applications

**Tradeoffs:**
- More complex key management (RSA key pair vs single secret)
- Slightly slower signing than HS256 (negligible at this scale)
- Requires generating and securely storing RSA key pair

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. HS256 — simpler, single secret, but every service that verifies tokens needs the secret (risk)

---

## [DECISION-008] No localStorage for Tokens

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Where to store JWT access and refresh tokens on the frontend.

**Decision:**
HttpOnly Secure SameSite=Strict cookies only. No localStorage, no sessionStorage.

**Rationale:**
- localStorage is accessible to JavaScript — any XSS vulnerability exposes all tokens to theft
- HttpOnly cookies are inaccessible to JavaScript — XSS cannot steal them
- Secure flag: cookie only sent over HTTPS
- SameSite=Strict: prevents CSRF on navigation

**Tradeoffs:**
- Requires CSRF protection (double-submit cookie or SameSite=Strict handles most cases)
- Slightly more complex cross-origin setup (credentials: 'include' required)
- Not trivially accessible from JS (intentional)

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. localStorage — rejected: XSS-vulnerable
2. In-memory only (JS variable) — rejected: lost on page refresh, poor UX
3. sessionStorage — rejected: lost on tab close, still XSS-vulnerable

## [DECISION-009] Railway.app for Free Deployment

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Need free hosting that supports Node.js + PostgreSQL + Redis in one platform.

**Decision:**
Railway.app for API + DB + Redis. Vercel for frontend.

**Rationale:**
- Railway free tier: $5 credit/month, PostgreSQL and Redis as managed services, zero-downtime deploys
- No cold start penalty (unlike serverless platforms)
- GitHub integration: auto-deploy on push to main
- Prisma migrations run as part of deploy command
- Vercel: best-in-class for React/Vite static sites, free tier generous, global CDN

**Tradeoffs:**
- Railway free tier has sleep after 30min inactivity (can cause slow first response)
- 512MB RAM limit on free tier (sufficient for our load)
- Not as scalable as AWS/GCP — but we'll migrate when revenue justifies it

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Render.com — similar free tier, good alternative, but Railway has better PostgreSQL support
2. Heroku — once free, now paid only
3. Fly.io — great but more complex setup (Docker required)
4. Supabase — considered for DB only, but would split our stack

---

## [DECISION-010] Landmark-Based Addresses (No Pin Code)

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
How to collect delivery addresses in a hill town where formal addresses don't exist, streets are unnamed, and pin codes are irrelevant for last-mile navigation.

**Decision:**
Mandatory landmark description field ("near the red gate, behind Hotel Padmini") + optional flat/room number. No pin code field. Optional lat/lng from draggable map pin.

**Rationale:**
- Mussoorie has ~200,000 residents + significant tourist traffic. Formal addresses (D-45 Sector 3) are meaningless here.
- Local riders navigate by landmarks (everyone knows "the red gate" or "Clock Tower")
- Pin code-based systems fail in hill towns — multiple areas share the same pin code
- Tourist buyers won't know their own address — but they know the hotel name
- This is how Zomato/Swiggy actually work in smaller Indian cities: landmark fields

**Tradeoffs:**
- Cannot use automated routing or geocoding based on address text alone
- Requires riders to know the area (they do — that's the point)
- Harder for first-time buyers to know what to write (addressed by placeholder copy)

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Standard address form (street, city, pin) — rejected: unusable in this geography
2. Lat/Lng only from GPS — rejected: tourists don't trust GPS accuracy in hills, buildings not mapped well
3. What3Words — considered but adds third-party dependency and learning curve

---

## [DECISION-011] BullMQ for Background Jobs

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Some operations should be async: sending OTP SMS (don't make user wait for SMS API), sending order confirmation notifications, generating reports.

**Decision:**
BullMQ with Redis. Already have Redis for sessions, so no additional infrastructure.

**Rationale:**
- Redis-backed: persistent queues (jobs survive server restart)
- Rate limiting built in (matches our OTP rate limiting needs)
- Retry with backoff: if Fast2SMS is slow, job retries automatically
- Dashboard: Bull Board for monitoring (can add later)
- Already have Redis — no extra infra cost

**Tradeoffs:**
- Additional complexity in the codebase (workers, queues, job types)
- Debugging async failures is harder than synchronous failures

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Synchronous OTP send — simpler but user waits for SMS API (can be 1-3 seconds)
2. pg-boss (PostgreSQL-backed queues) — good, but adds complexity when we have Redis anyway
3. In-memory queue (no persistence) — rejected: jobs lost on server restart

## [DECISION-012] GSAP over Framer Motion for Animations

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The design calls for premium scroll-based animations and smooth page transitions. Which animation library?

**Decision:**
GSAP v3 with ScrollTrigger plugin for all scroll-based and timeline animations. Lenis for smooth scroll.

**Rationale:**
- GSAP is the industry standard for premium web animations (used by Apple, Netflix, etc.)
- ScrollTrigger is the best-in-class scroll animation tool
- Performance: GSAP uses requestAnimationFrame and optimizes painting
- Lenis + GSAP is the canonical pairing for "smooth scroll website" experiences
- The design system explicitly calls for topographic backgrounds, fog drift, ETA pulse — all well-suited to GSAP
- GSAP is free for non-commercial + many commercial uses (GreenSock standard license)

**Tradeoffs:**
- Heavier than CSS transitions or Framer Motion for simple animations
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger = ~70KB (minified+gzipped: ~25KB) — acceptable for a premium web app
- Requires imperative programming style (refs in React) vs Framer Motion's declarative

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Framer Motion — good for component-level animations, but limited for complex scroll sequences
2. CSS animations only — cannot achieve the level of animation sophistication required
3. AOS (Animate on Scroll) — too simple, CSS-only, not customizable enough

---

## [DECISION-013] TanStack Query for Server State

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Managing server state (API data) in React. Options: Redux, Zustand, TanStack Query, SWR.

**Decision:**
TanStack Query (React Query) for server state. Zustand for pure client state (auth, cart UI, weather mode toggle).

**Rationale:**
- TanStack Query handles: caching, background refetch, stale-while-revalidate, optimistic updates, pagination, infinite scroll — all built in
- Separates server state from UI state — cleaner mental model
- Zustand is perfect for simple global UI state (is cart open? is weather mode on?)
- No Redux — too much boilerplate for what we need

**Tradeoffs:**
- Two state management solutions in one project — but they serve clearly different purposes
- TanStack Query has a learning curve

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Redux Toolkit + RTK Query — good, but heavier than needed
2. SWR — similar to React Query but less feature-rich (no optimistic updates OOTB)
3. Zustand for everything — possible, but you'd reinvent React Query's caching logic

## [DECISION-014] Hybrid Env Bootstrap for Railway + dotenv-safe

**Date:** 2026-04-22
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Production deploys on Railway failed at bootstrap with `MissingEnvVarsError` from `dotenv-safe` even after setting variables in the dashboard. Two concrete issues appeared:
- Monorepo root path resolution was off by one level, so `.env.example` was searched under `/app/apps/.env.example` instead of `/app/.env.example`.
- `dotenv-safe` checks key presence using `Object.keys(process.env)`; Railway may omit some keys entirely rather than set empty values, causing strict validation to fail.

**Decision:**
Adopt a hybrid bootstrap in `apps/api/src/config/env.ts`:
1. Resolve monorepo root correctly (4 levels above `config` directory).
2. Ensure `.env` file exists on PaaS (create empty file when missing).
3. Load `.env` with `dotenv` first.
4. Prime missing keys from `.env.example` into `process.env` (including `DATABASE_URL_TEST <- DATABASE_URL` fallback) before running `dotenv-safe`.
5. Keep `dotenv-safe` as the final contract validator.

**Rationale:**
- Preserves strict configuration contract semantics from `.env.example`.
- Avoids false negatives caused by platform-specific env injection behavior.
- Keeps local dev ergonomics unchanged while making production bootstrap deterministic.
- Minimizes invasive changes to the rest of the app.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Adds env bootstrap complexity (`dotenv` + priming helper + `dotenv-safe`).
- Placeholders can satisfy key-presence checks even when not production-grade values; operational discipline still required in Railway Variables.
- Slightly more code to test and maintain in config initialization.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Remove `dotenv-safe` in production — rejected: loses safety guarantees and schema contract.
2. Set `allowEmptyValues: false` and rely purely on platform vars — rejected: still fails when keys are omitted entirely by host behavior.
3. Maintain a committed production `.env` template in runtime image — rejected: operationally fragile and risks secrets handling mistakes.
4. Replace with a custom Zod env loader only — deferred: possible future refactor, but more scope than needed for immediate deployment unblock.

## [DECISION-015] ESLint: simple-import-sort vs import/order on `order.service.ts`

**Date:** 2026-04-23
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
While adding `apps/api/src/modules/order/order.service.ts`, ESLint reported import issues. Running `eslint --fix` produced `ESLintCircularFixesWarning: Circular fixes detected` — two rules kept undoing each other’s fixes until the run could not converge.

**Decision:**
Disable `import/order` only for that file via a top-of-file comment:

`/* eslint-disable import/order -- simple-import-sort groups conflict with newlines-between: always for parent imports */`

Leave `simple-import-sort/imports` as the authority for import order and grouping in that module. Longer term, the project may relax or remove `import/order` in favor of `simple-import-sort` only, or narrow `newlines-between`, to avoid repeats.

**Rationale:**
- The root conflict is **two different import policies**: `eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort` defines order and newlines in one way; `eslint-plugin-import`’s `import/order` with `newlines-between: "always"` enforces extra blank lines between *groups* (e.g. external vs parent `../` vs sibling `./`, and sometimes between adjacent parent modules).
- Those rules **disagree** for files that mix `../catalog/...`, `../inventory/...`, and `./order.repository.js` — satisfying one can violate the other, producing circular autofixes.
- A targeted disable documents the reason and unblocks CI without changing global lint policy in one go.

**Tradeoffs:**
- `import/order` is not enforced in that one file, so a future contributor could add imports that `import/order` would have nudged; `simple-import-sort` still normalizes order on save/CI.
- A file-level `eslint-disable` is slightly noisier than a single source of import rules for the whole repo.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Remove `newlines-between: "always"` from `import/order` globally — broader change, affects every package; deferred until a dedicated lint pass.
2. Drop `simple-import-sort` and use only `import/order` — rejected: the repo has standardized on `simple-import-sort` for sort order; larger churn.
3. Re-export catalog/inventory from a single `order`-local barrel to reduce import paths — overkill to fix lint only.

## [DECISION-016] Phase-Level API Contract Gates (Vertical Slice Rule)

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
During Phase 2.6, the buyer categories UI was completed and tested on the frontend, but runtime backend exposure drifted (`GET /api/v1/categories` initially not wired in app route registration; credentialed CORS mismatch blocked browser calls). The issue was eventually fixed, but the gap showed that phase checklist items did not explicitly enforce backend endpoint exposure and runtime wiring in the same phase.

**Decision:**
Adopt a mandatory **API Contract Gate** for each buyer phase section (2.7+). A phase is not complete until:
- UI is implemented
- required backend endpoint(s) are implemented
- backend integration tests pass for those endpoint contracts
- routes are registered in runtime app wiring (not only tested through module-local registration)
- frontend tests validate expected API envelope and error/empty/loading behavior

Add an intermediate **Phase 2.61** checklist step for post-2.6 hardening (categories/CORS closure + auth runtime wiring verification) before proceeding deeper into catalog/checkout phases.

**Rationale:**
- Prevents repeating frontend/backend drift discovered in 2.6.
- Forces vertical-slice delivery (UI + API + tests + runtime wiring) instead of partial horizontal progress.
- Makes checklist completion criteria explicit for future sessions/agents.
- Improves deploy confidence since CI green better reflects real runtime behavior.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Slightly higher per-phase scope and sequencing discipline required.
- More integration tests per phase increases short-term implementation time.
- Checklist grows longer, but becomes clearer and safer.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Keep current checklist style and rely on agent memory — rejected: too error-prone.
2. Build all future APIs upfront in a dedicated backend phase — rejected: increases speculative work and disconnects API delivery from UI needs.
3. Add only a global note once — rejected: less enforceable than per-phase gates.

---

## [DECISION-017] Universal API Contract Gate Across Phases 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
After adding API Contract Gates to buyer phases (2.7+), a follow-up concern identified the same drift risk for later areas: Phase 2.17+, Store Owner (Phase 3), Admin (Phase 4), and future Rider work (Phase 5). Keeping gates only in buyer sections would make enforcement inconsistent and agent-dependent.

**Decision:**
Make API Contract Gate policy universal:
- Add a global rule in `rules_and_spec.md` under TDD rules as a mandatory phase completion gate.
- Add explicit gate checklists at the beginning of Phase 3 and Phase 4 sections in `current_state.md`.
- Add explicit gate checklist placeholder for Phase 5 (deferred rider implementation) in `current_state.md`.
- Continue phase-level gate bullets in feature sections where practical (already done for Phase 2.7+).

**Rationale:**
- Ensures the same “UI + API + tests + runtime wiring” standard across buyer, store, admin, and rider work.
- Reduces chance of route-registration drift in later phases.
- Gives future sessions a single enforceable source of truth, not implied conventions.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Checklists become longer and more repetitive.
- Slightly more process overhead before marking tasks complete.
- Requires discipline to keep gate bullets updated as phases evolve.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Keep gates only in Phase 2 — rejected: inconsistent enforcement.
2. Keep only decision-log guidance without checklist updates — rejected: too implicit.
3. Enforce only through CI without checklist language — rejected: CI can pass while runtime wiring still drifts.

## [DECISION-018] Phase 2.10.1 — Auth Plumbing Before Live SMS OTP Provider

**Date:** 2026-04-29  
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Phase 2.10 delivered buyer OTP **UX** + API contract gates, but runtime wiring still used **dev stubs** (e.g., placeholder token strings, non-persisted synthetic user ids, OTP sender no-op). Product discussion clarified that **production-grade auth plumbing** (DB user rows, consistent JWT/token lifecycle, swappable OTP delivery) **does not depend** on subscribing to Fast2SMS immediately.

**Decision:**
Add an explicit **`Phase 2.10.1` buyer auth plumbing slice** in `CONTEXT/current_state.md` that completes **before** checkout flows that rely on durable identity (`2.11+`), with:
- **`OtpProvider` interface** + **dev/stub provider** for local and automated tests (no outbound SMS required to mark GREEN).
- **Find-or-create buyer `User`** in PostgreSQL on successful `verify-otp` (phone unique, role `BUYER`).
- **Real `TokenService` wiring** per `rules_and_spec.md` §6 (RS256, `jti`, Redis allowlist, refresh rotation, logout revoke) — with a documented escape hatch only if an interim algorithm is strictly necessary.
- **Cryptographically random OTP** + existing Redis+bcrypt OTP storage semantics.
- **Full TDD / API Contract Gate**: backend integration + unit tests, frontend tests aligned to real verify envelope, `ci:quality` green.

**Rationale:**
- Unblocks **durable buyer identity** and token semantics without blocking on SMS vendor onboarding, API keys, or spend.
- Keeps **Fast2SMS (DECISION-006)** as a **drop-in implementation** of `OtpProvider` later, not a rewrite of auth core.
- Avoids false progress: checkout and orders need a stable `userId` in DB, not a client-generated placeholder.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Extra phase and checklist surface area before 2.11.
- Team must still budget time for **production SMS** integration + env hardening before go-live (separate from 2.10.1 “plumbing complete”).

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Bundle DB + token plumbing into Phase 2.11 checkout — rejected: identity is prerequisite for checkout and order attribution; delaying it increases rework.
2. Require live Fast2SMS before any DB persistence — rejected: couples infrastructure procurement to core engineering milestones.
3. Implicit signup only via frontend state — rejected: violates data model and audit needs for orders.

## [DECISION-019] Temporary Production OTP Override for Railway QA (`GOROLA_DUMMY_OTP`)

**Date:** 2026-04-29  
**Status:** Accepted (Temporary)

**Context:**
After Phase 2.10.1, buyer OTP generation became random by default and SMS delivery remained a noop provider until Fast2SMS integration. On Railway, manual QA needed a deterministic OTP to exercise login/refresh/logout before real SMS wiring. Browser console reports showed CORS errors, but the primary issue was upstream API availability (`502`) during env/setup churn.

**Decision:**
Introduce a temporary environment variable override in `generateBuyerOtp`:
- `GOROLA_DUMMY_OTP` (must be exactly 6 digits) forces OTP value in all environments, including production.
- Keep `NODE_ENV=production` on Railway and continue requiring valid `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` / `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` PEMs for startup.
- Keep existing `GOROLA_TEST_OTP` behavior scoped to `NODE_ENV=test`.

**Rationale:**
- Enables manual OTP login verification on Railway immediately without changing auth route contracts.
- Avoids misusing `NODE_ENV` as a feature flag (e.g., switching production runtime to `test` or `development`).
- Keeps the temporary bridge explicit, env-gated, and easy to remove once Fast2SMS is wired.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Fixed OTP in production-like environment is insecure if left enabled.
- Adds another environment knob that can be forgotten without explicit cleanup.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Set `NODE_ENV=test` on Railway and use `GOROLA_TEST_OTP` — rejected: changes broader runtime behavior and diverges from production semantics.
2. Keep random OTP with noop provider — rejected: no practical way to complete manual auth QA.
3. Implement Fast2SMS immediately — deferred: outside current phase sequencing; checkout work should continue first.

## [DECISION-020] Cross-Site Refresh Cookie Policy for Vercel ↔ Railway

**Date:** 2026-04-29  
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Buyer OTP verify succeeded but browser console showed: refresh cookie rejected in cross-site context because `SameSite` was `Lax`. Frontend and API are on different sites (`*.vercel.app` and `*.railway.app`), so refresh cookie writes happen in a cross-site request path. Follow-up checks confirmed this is concentrated in auth refresh-token cookie handling (buyer/store-owner/admin), not a broader non-auth cookie issue.

**Decision:**
Set refresh-token cookie attributes by environment in auth controllers:
- **Production:** `SameSite=None` + `Secure=true` + `Partitioned=true` (cross-site compatible over HTTPS and aligned with Chrome third-party cookie deprecation / CHIPS warning).
- **Non-production:** keep `SameSite=Lax` for local same-site dev behavior.

Applied in `auth.controller.ts` through shared `refreshCookieOptions()` used by buyer/store-owner/admin login + refresh handlers, and mirrored clear options in logout via `refreshCookieClearOptions()` so cookie deletion works under the same cross-site policy.

**Rationale:**
- Required for cross-site cookie persistence in modern browsers.
- `Partitioned` addresses Chrome warning (`cookie ... is foreign and does not have the "Partitioned" attribute`) for third-party cookie hardening.
- Keeps secure defaults in production while minimizing local-dev friction.
- Removes misleading downstream symptoms where auth appears to fail even when OTP verify itself succeeds.
- Matching clear attributes avoids stale refresh cookies when logout executes in cross-site contexts.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Cross-site cookies increase CSRF exposure surface and require tighter origin controls.
- Depends on HTTPS in production (`Secure` mandatory when `SameSite=None`).
- `Partitioned` behavior support is browser-dependent and should be monitored across target clients.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Keep `SameSite=Lax` and rely only on refresh token in JSON body — rejected for now: inconsistent with intended HttpOnly cookie refresh posture (DECISION-008).
2. Move web and API under one same-site domain immediately — deferred: infra/domain work outside current phase scope.
3. Disable cookie usage and keep refresh strictly client-managed — rejected: weaker security posture vs HttpOnly design intent.

## [DECISION-021] Phase 2.11.1 — Dedicated Wiring Hardening Slice Before 2.12

**Date:** 2026-04-30  
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
After Phase 2.11 checkout delivery, runtime smoke testing exposed cross-layer wiring defects that were not feature-logic bugs: missing buyer route landing (`/orders/:id`), category response shape drift (`productCount` expectation), route discoverability dead-ends (`/about`, `/support`), placeholder-route exposure, and auth bootstrap/guard timing races. These issues created user-facing inconsistency despite green feature tests.

**Decision:**
Introduce **Phase 2.11.1** as a strict-TDD wiring hardening slice before/alongside Phase 2.12:
- Track wiring issues explicitly in `current_state.md` with API/route/identity contract gates.
- Fix each issue via RED→GREEN regression tests first, then implementation.
- Mark already-fixed wiring regressions (category page wrong-category flash) as completed under 2.11.1.
- Prioritize P0 wiring defects that break primary buyer journey continuity ahead of new feature depth.

**Rationale:**
- Preserves vertical-slice integrity by treating wiring contracts as first-class deliverables, not incidental cleanup.
- Prevents “green tests, broken journey” drift between frontend UI assumptions and runtime backend behavior.
- Reduces compounding risk before 2.12 confirmation flow depends on correct post-checkout navigation.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Adds a short hardening phase and slows immediate feature progression.
- Expands checklist and regression surface area in the near term.
- Requires disciplined issue triage to avoid turning 2.11.1 into an open-ended backlog.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Fold wiring fixes ad hoc into 2.12 implementation — rejected: high risk of mixing regression causes with new confirmation logic.
2. Defer wiring cleanup to a later QA sweep — rejected: user journey breakages are already visible in active buyer flow.
3. Fix only critical route bugs, ignore contract/discoverability issues — rejected: partial cleanup would leave repeated edge-case failures.

## [DECISION-022] 2.11.1 End-to-End Wiring Closure Matrix (UI -> API -> Route -> Service/Repo -> DB)

**Date:** 2026-04-30  
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Phase 2.11.1 began as a wiring hardening effort after runtime smoke findings (navigation dead-ends, API shape drift, guard/bootstrap race, and consistency issues). A simple issue list is not sufficient: several defects look fixed at UI level while backend/runtime/DB expectations can still drift. Team requested explicit end-to-end closure criteria for every listed issue.

**Decision:**
For every 2.11.1 wiring issue, completion requires a mandatory closure matrix:
1. **UI trigger/assertion** (component/router behavior),
2. **Network contract assertion** (path/method/payload/auth),
3. **Runtime route coverage** (`App.tsx` or API route graph registration),
4. **Service/repository behavior assertion** (integration/unit as appropriate),
5. **DB state assertion** (read/write invariants),
6. **Strict TDD sequence** (RED regression first, then GREEN implementation).

Additionally, 2.11.1 tracks the full wiring register (`W-001`..`W-009`) and marks only verifiable closures as checked.

**Rationale:**
- Prevents partial fixes where frontend appears corrected but backend/DB semantics remain inconsistent.
- Aligns with DECISION-016/017 API Contract Gate intent by extending from endpoint reachability to full journey integrity.
- Provides auditable traceability from user symptom to root cause to persistent-state correctness.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Higher implementation and test overhead per issue.
- Slower short-term feature throughput while hardening is in progress.
- Requires disciplined test design to avoid brittle over-specification.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. UI-only regression closure for 2.11.1 — rejected: previously allowed runtime/DB drift to survive.
2. API-only contract checks without DB assertions — rejected: insufficient for identity/pricing/order ownership issues.
3. Postpone matrix discipline until later phases — rejected: buyer flow is live and already affected by wiring inconsistencies.

## [DECISION-023] — Prisma Transaction Timeout & Order Flow Optimization

**Date:** 2026-05-01
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** 
In cloud deployments (Railway), users reported an `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` (P2028: Transaction not found) on the first "Place Order" attempt. Investigation revealed a "chatty" transaction logic performing 40+ sequential database calls inside a 5-second timeout window, which is easily exceeded during infrastructure cold starts.

**Decision:**
1.  Increase the global transaction timeout for **all core order flows** (Placement and Cancellation) to **15 seconds**.
2.  Optimize `OrderService.placeOrderWithStock` and `OrderService.cancelOrderWithStockRestore` to use **Bulk-Fetching** (`findMany`) instead of sequential loops.
3.  Optimize `OrderRepository.create` to use Prisma's `include` feature for single-round-trip creation + hydration.
4.  Update `ProductVariantRepository` (`decrementStock` and `incrementStock`) to support pre-fetched data, eliminating redundant reads.

**Rationale:**
- Checkout and Cancellation latency for a multi-item cart is reduced by **~75%**.
- High resilience to cold starts on Railway/Vercel.
- Unit tests added/updated to verify optimized call sequences and `findMany` usage.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Service layer must now map IDs and pass data to repositories, slightly increasing code length for significant performance gains.

## [DECISION-024] Order Rating Model (Thumbs Up/Down + Optional Comment)

**Date:** 2026-05-02
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
For Phase 2.15 (Order History + Reorder), we needed a way for buyers to rate completed orders. The initial requirement was "no stars, just thumbs up / thumbs down".

**Decision:**
Add `rating Boolean?` and `ratingComment String?` to the `Order` model in Prisma.
- `rating`: `true` means thumbs up, `false` means thumbs down, `null` means unrated.
- `ratingComment`: Optional text feedback provided alongside the rating.

**Rationale:**
- A boolean perfectly captures the binary "thumbs up/down" requirement without the complexity of a 5-star scale.
- Adding the `ratingComment` field proactively allows users to leave qualitative feedback (e.g., "Food was cold", "Driver was polite"), which is highly valuable for store owners.
- Keeping these on the `Order` model avoids creating a separate `Review` table, simplifying the schema and reducing join overhead for order history queries.

**Tradeoffs:**
- A boolean cannot support a "neutral" rating if requested in the future. If a 3-tier system (happy, neutral, sad) is ever needed, we will have to migrate `rating` to an `Int` or `Enum`.
- Storing text comments on the `Order` table slightly increases row size, but this is negligible in PostgreSQL.

## [DECISION-025] CI/CD Test Stabilization (Explicit Serialization & API Fallback)

**Date:** 2026-05-02
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
After implementing Phase 2.15 (Order Rating), the project's CI/CD pipeline failed due to:
1.  **"Ghost Feedback" Bug**: The UI incorrectly showed "Rating submitted" for unrated orders because the backend was excluding the `rating` field (returning `undefined` instead of `null`).
2.  **TypeError in Tests**: Frontend tests crashed in GitHub Actions because the `api` singleton was `null` due to missing environment variables.
3.  **FK Violations**: Integration tests failed during database cleanup because newly added `Advertisement` records blocked the deletion of `Store` records.

**Decision:**
1.  **Explicit Serialization**: Update `order.controller.ts` to explicitly include `rating: order.rating` and `ratingComment: order.ratingComment` in the serialized response.
2.  **Test-Safe API**: Modify `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` to provide a fallback URL (`http://test-api`) if `import.meta.env.MODE === 'test'`, ensuring the `api` instance is never `null` during tests.
3.  **Hierarchical Cleanup**: Update all integration test cleanup functions to follow a strict "Leaf-to-Root" deletion order (e.g., delete `Advertisement` before `Store`).

**Rationale:**
- Explicitly mapping fields in the controller ensures the API contract is reliable and never dependent on Prisma's default omit/include behavior.
- Providing a fallback URL during tests prevents infrastructure dependencies (like environment variables) from blocking purely functional unit tests.
- Hierarchical cleanup is a best practice for integration testing with relational databases to maintain isolation without violating referential integrity.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Manually mapping fields adds a few lines to the controller but prevents "magic" bugs where fields disappear.
- The dummy test URL prevents real network calls during tests (which is usually desired) but could hide configuration issues that only surface at runtime.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1.  Using a global database trigger for cascade deletes — rejected: too complex for test-only cleanup.

## [DECISION-026] State-Aware Order Details UI

**Date:** 2026-05-02
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The `OrderConfirmationPage` was originally designed as a high-fidelity "Success" screen with cinematic GSAP animations (the "bloom" effect) and hardcoded "Thank you" messaging. However, this same page is used as the primary view for tracking order status and viewing order details from history. Seeing a "Thank you for ordering" bloom on a 3-day-old delivered order creates a confusing and unprofessional user experience.

**Decision:**
Implement a status-driven UI state machine within the `OrderConfirmationPage`. The page will dynamically adjust visibility and content based on the `status` payload from the API:

1.  **Fresh Success (`PLACED`)**: High-fidelity bloom animation, "Thank you" header, and active status tracking.
2.  **In-Progress (`PREPARING` / `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`)**: Utility-focused view. Hide "Thank you" (switch to "Store is picking items" or "On the way"). Keep ETA trust copy and Store Contact cards visible for active assistance.
3.  **Completion (`DELIVERED`)**: "Success" state focused on history and feedback.
    *   **Hide**: Bloom, Store Contact card, ETA trust copy, and Drop-off cues.
    *   **Show**: "Order Delivered" header, a new **"Delivered in XXm" duration badge**, and Rating UI.
4.  **Failure (`CANCELLED`)**: Neutral informational state.
    *   **Hide**: Bloom, Status Stepper (or grey it out), Contact cards, and ETA text.
    *   **Show**: "Order Cancelled" header and clear cancellation notice.

**Rationale:**
- Improves the transition from "Post-Checkout" (excitement-focused) to "Tracking/History" (utility-focused).
- Prevents animation fatigue by showing the expensive cinematic entrance only once (at the moment of success).
- Better aligns the UI with the real-world state of the order.
- As a quick-commerce app, GoRola must feel reliable. Historical views should emphasize utility (receipt/feedback), while active orders should emphasize status and support.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Adds complexity to the component's internal logic (conditional rendering and timeline control).
- Requires careful handling of the transition states to ensure the page doesn't "flicker" while fetching the status.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1.  **Separate Pages:** Create a `OrderDetailPage` separate from `OrderConfirmationPage`. Rejected: This would duplicate significant amounts of layout and logic (items list, totals, store info).
2.  **Stateless Redirects:** Redirect to a different component within the same route based on status. Rejected: Harder to handle entry animations consistently.

---

## [DECISION-027] Cinematic Animation Timing for Order Success

**Date:** 2026-05-02
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The "green bloom" animation on the `OrderConfirmationPage` was reported as feeling "jittery" or too fast. The initial implementation began the fade-out immediately upon mount, not allowing the user to register the success state before the transition to the content began.

**Decision:**
Introduce a "hold" phase and slow down the GSAP timeline:
1.  **Hold Time:** Add a 0.5s–0.8s pause where the green bloom is at full opacity to signify the "Success" impact.
2.  **Slower Reveal:** Extend the bloom fade duration and stagger the checkmark drawing more deliberately.
3.  **Easing:** Shift to `power3.out` for the reveal to create a more premium, "braking" feel as the content settles.

**Rationale:**
- High-fidelity animations require a clear beginning, middle, and end. The current version skipped the "beginning" (the impact) and went straight to the "end" (the reveal).
- Slower transitions feel more expensive and deliberate, reducing the perception of technical glitches or frame drops.

## [DECISION-028] Address Snapshoting for Order History

**Date:** 2026-05-02
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Currently, the `Order` model only stores the `landmarkDescription`. It does not store the user-provided `addressLabel` (e.g., "Home") or `flatRoom` number. Additionally, if an order were to simply link to the user's `Address` record, deleting or editing that address profile later would break the historical record of where the order was actually delivered.

**Decision:**
Instead of linking to the `Address` table, we will **snapshot** (copy) the address details into the `Order` record at the time of purchase. We will add `addressLabel` and `flatRoom` (optional) fields to the `Order` model.

**Rationale:**
- **Immutability**: Historical orders must reflect exactly where they were delivered at the time of the transaction. If a user moves house, their old orders should still show their old address details.
- **Robustness**: If a user deletes an address profile, the order history remains intact.
- **Uniformity**: Allows the same UI to handle both saved addresses and "one-time" addresses that were never saved to a profile.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Small amount of data duplication (denormalization).
- Requires a database migration.

## [DECISION-029] Three-Tier Catalog Hierarchy (Category -> SubCategory -> Product)

**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Initially, the GoRola catalog was a flat two-tier system (`Category -> Product`). However, as the product range expanded (e.g., Groceries containing Rice, Snacks, Beverages), the UI became cluttered. A middle tier was needed to organize products more logically for buyers.

**Decision:**
Introduce a `SubCategory` model and enforce a mandatory relationship at the database level.
- `SubCategory` belongs to a `Category` (`1:N`).
- `Product` belongs to a `SubCategory` (`N:1`).
- `subCategoryId` on the `Product` model is **non-nullable** (mandatory).
- Replace `emoji` field on `Category` and `SubCategory` with `imageUrl` for a more premium visual experience.

**Rationale:**
- **Better UX:** Allows buyers to drill down into specific niches (e.g., "Medical -> Pain Relief") instead of scrolling through hundreds of unrelated items.
- **Data Integrity:** Making `subCategoryId` non-nullable ensures that every product is strictly categorized, preventing "orphan" products from appearing in search or category results.
- **Visual Consistency:** Moving from emojis to high-quality images aligns with the premium "GoRola" aesthetic established in Phase 2.

**Tradeoffs:**
- **Constraint Hell:** Making the relationship mandatory broke all existing test data and seeding scripts across the entire repository. Every integration test that seeds a product now requires a sub-category setup.
- **Migration Complexity:** Required a complete database reset for both dev and test environments as existing products could not be automatically backfilled with a mandatory FK.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Optional `subCategoryId` — Rejected: Leads to inconsistent UI where some products are grouped and others are not.
2. Tagging system — Rejected: Overly complex for a local commerce app where hierarchical navigation is the expected standard.
3. JSON metadata for sub-categories — Rejected: Prevents database-level referential integrity and makes filtering queries significantly slower.

## [DECISION-030] Guest-to-User Cart Synchronization (Reconciliation Strategy)

**Date:** 2026-05-05
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
During the checkout flow, guest users (not logged in) add items to their local cart. When they log in to complete the purchase, the application was erroneously clearing the local cart if the server-side cart was empty, leading to a "Empty Cart" error at the final payment step.

**Decision:**
Implement a "Push-on-Empty" reconciliation strategy in `buyer-cart-sync.ts`:
1. If an authenticated user has an empty server cart BUT has items in their local guest cart, push all guest items to the server.
2. If both carts have items, the server cart remains the source of truth (to prevent duplication across devices).
3. Local state is strictly updated from the server response AFTER the reconciliation attempt.

**Rationale:**
- **Prevents Conversion Drop-off:** Ensures that users don't lose their selected items the moment they sign in to pay.
- **Data Integrity:** Avoids complex merging logic (e.g., summing quantities) which can lead to desyncs. The server remains the ultimate source of truth.
- **Simplicity:** High reliability with minimal background network overhead.

**Tradeoffs:**
- If a user intentionally wants to discard their local cart in favor of an empty server cart, they cannot (the local items will be "restored" to the server). However, this is an extreme edge case compared to the common bug of losing items.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Aggressive Merge:** Always sum local + server quantities. Rejected: Risk of exceeding stock limits silently and creates complex race conditions.
2. **Clear Local Always:** Rejected: Caused the original bug.

## [DECISION-031] CI/CD Security Hardening (Backend Scrutiny vs. Frontend/Test Exclusions)

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The GoRola monorepo uses `eslint-plugin-security` to detect common Node.js vulnerabilities. However, applying these rules indiscriminately across the entire monorepo caused significant "noise" (false positives) in the React frontend and Vitest suites, where the server-side attack vectors (like path traversal or server memory injection) are physically impossible or contextually irrelevant.

**Decision:**
1. **Enforce Strict Quality Gates:** Updated `ci:quality` and GitHub workflows to use `pnpm lint --max-warnings 0`. Any warning now breaks the build.
2. **Backend Strictness:** Keep security rules 100% active for `apps/api`. Silencing is only allowed via `// eslint-disable-next-line` on verified, line-by-line false positives.
3. **Frontend & Test Exclusions:** Explicitly disable security rules in `eslint.config.ts` for all files matching `apps/web/**` and `**/*.test.ts`.

**Rationale:**
- **Risk Mitigation:** The Backend (`apps/api`) is the only environment where these vulnerabilities (path traversal, server-side object injection) present a real threat. Strict, line-level auditing ensures the server remains a fortress.
- **Eliminating Alert Fatigue:** Frontend React code runs in a client browser and has no server access. Forcing backend rules onto the frontend leads to "alert fatigue," where developers learn to ignore security warnings because they are "always false."
- **Focus:** By removing the noise in the frontend and tests, we ensure that when a security warning *does* appear in the backend, it receives immediate and high-priority attention from the team.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Frontend code is no longer scanned for these specific security rules. However, React and Vite have their own built-in protections for frontend-specific threats like XSS (via JSX auto-escaping).

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Line-by-line silencing for the whole repo:** Rejected. Adding 50+ disable comments in React components just to handle basic state access is unmaintainable and reduces developer velocity without adding security value.
2. **Disable the plugin entirely:** Rejected. We need the protection for the backend API.

## [DECISION-032] Phase 7 Booking Commerce Architecture & Hybrid Schema

**Date:** 2026-05-18
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
GoRola is expanding from purely "Quick Commerce" (instant checkout, immediate rider delivery, physical inventory deduction) to support "Booking Commerce" services (e.g., medical test appointments, home appliance/hardware repairs). This requires a schema and ordering flow that supports calendar-date scheduling, buyer-selected timeslots, fasting constraints, merchant-side approval queues, and field technician dispatch, all while completely isolating and preserving the existing quick-commerce flow.

**Decision:**
Extend the Prisma schema and business logic under a unified, hybrid architecture:
1. **DB Schema Extensions**:
   - Introduce `StoreType` enum (`QUICK_COMMERCE`, `BOOKING_COMMERCE`) on the `Store` model to control the overall workflow.
   - Introduce `OrderType` enum (`QUICK`, `BOOKING`) on the `Order` model.
   - Introduce `BookingOrder` model (one-to-one relationship with `Order`) to house booking-specific fields (`scheduledDate`, `timeslot`, `requiresFasting`, `approvalStatus`, `rejectionReason`, `assignedTechnicianId`).
   - Add new `BookingApprovalStatus` enum: `PENDING_APPROVAL`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`.
   - Add new `RiderType` enum (`DELIVERY`, `FIELD_TECHNICIAN`) on the `DeliveryRider` model to support field technician dispatch.
   - Extend `OrderStatus` enum to include `PENDING_APPROVAL` and `APPROVED` status options for booking orders.
2. **Strict Flow Isolation & Core Rules**:
   - **Cart Bypass**: Booking order products bypass the shopping cart entirely. The buyer clicks "Book Now" on a product detail page, which redirects to the booking scheduler flow.
   - **No Stock Deduction**: Booking orders represent services rather than physical inventory. They bypass the quick commerce stock movements (`StockMovement`) and stock depletion locks.
   - **Fasting Regulations**: Fasting tests (`requiresFasting: true`) only permit selecting the early morning slot `"06:00-09:00"`; other slots are filtered out.
   - **Booking Lead Days**: Ensure calendar scheduling respects the store's `bookingLeadDays` configuration (e.g. if `leadDays = 1`, today is disabled).
   - **Merchant Approval Gate**: Placed bookings enter `PENDING_APPROVAL` state, requiring the store owner to explicitly approve (`APPROVED`) or reject (`REJECTED` with a non-empty reason). Buyers can cancel pending bookings at any time, but cannot cancel approved bookings without store owner action.
3. **Dual-Aware Frontend Components**:
   - The product detail page, grid cards, and category views are updated to handle both store types seamlessly. A `storeType` property is serialized in all product and category API responses.
   - Separate dashboards/views are maintained under `/bookings/new` for scheduling and `/store/bookings` for merchants, so that booking-specific scheduling controls do not clutter the standard checkout interfaces.

**Rationale:**
- **Zero-Regression Guarantee**: Keeping standard quick commerce fully separated and unchanged means existing user paths and tests remain 100% functional.
- **Relational Integrity**: Placing booking metadata in a dedicated `BookingOrder` model keeps the `Order` table clean, avoids massive null columns on standard quick orders, and enforces clean foreign key referential constraints.
- **Improved UX & Conversion**: Bypassing the cart for bookings maps to standard service-hiring behaviors, eliminating confusion and reducing the steps needed to confirm an appointment.

**Tradeoffs:**
- Adds schema complexity (additional enums, tables, and conditional logic branches).
- The `OrderStatus` enum is shared, meaning quick commerce orders technically have access to status values like `PENDING_APPROVAL`, though this is strictly blocked at the application service/validation layers.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Separate Microservices / Repositories**: Rejected. The modular monolith structure handles both domains beautifully and enables sharing core user identity, addresses, and layout systems.
- **Polymorphic Table Inheritance**: Rejected. Prisma does not support model polymorphism easily, and creating completely separate Order tables for quick vs booking would break the shared history pages, order status tracking, and shared analytical reporting.
